Welcome to the SiphsMail Plugin for Wordpress!  

We built this tool to help website owners and publishers distribute their content across the web.  The plugin provides a simple interface for your site's visitors that encourages them to share your content via email or popular social media sites.  While other plugins provide similar functions, SiphsMail uniquely enables full customization of the interface, including the incorporation of a logo/brand and your own advertisements.  Additionally, the plugin provides all sorts of helpful statistics regarding your viewers' sharing activity.  

Installation of this plugin immediately provides the raw interface for your viewers. For instructions, please visit

For customization and statistics, you'll need to sign up for a free account through Siphs.com.  We dedicated to providing free versions of all of our tools, but we also support pay services with additional functionality.  If you have any problems, questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at support[at]siphs.com.

Happy sharing!
